# Installation

Navigate to the backend directory and run:

`bundle install`

There is dummy data available. If you would like to use it, run:

`rake db:seed`

Now start your server

`rails s`

Navigate to the frontend directory and run:

`npm install`

Now start the react server with

`npm start`

It will ask if you want to use a different port rather than the standard :3000. This is because the rails server is already on that port. Say yes, and it will start on a new port.

And that's it!
